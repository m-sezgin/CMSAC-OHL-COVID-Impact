	abstract = {The emergence of Player Development Coaches (PDC) in professional sports demonstrates recognition for the importance of fostering personal and professional development. Nonetheless, the processes by which PDCs facilitate such development are largely unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the perceptions, experiences, and responsibilities of current/former National Hockey League (NHL) PDCs. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight experienced NHL PDCs (Mage = 50.5, SD = 9.7). The PDCs reported working closely with athletes to oversee their development, which involved frequent meetings and evaluation of performances. They also described the necessity of establishing trust and ensuring transparency with their athletes, providing support (e.g., emotional), and engaging in reflective practice. In using these sport specific, relational, and introspective competencies, player development coaches guide athletes towards various professional (e.g., physical, psychological performance) and personal developmental outcomes (e.g., character). The findings indicate that PDCs act similarly to mentors, whereby the pillars of trust and respect are central to their perceived ability to impact athlete’s personal and professional development. In conclusion, in order to expedite the ultimate performance goal of getting athletes into the NHL, PDCs work collaboratively to reinforce and develop a range of developmental assets that span from improvements in performance to personal growth.Lay Summary: Eight player development coaches were interviewed to examine how they helped their athletes develop into full-time National Hockey League players. These individuals reported the importance of developing trusting relationships with their athletes, monitoring athlete performance/progress, and providing them with the necessary resources to facilitate sport-specific skill development as well as healthy and desirable personal growth.},

How these deficits, if present, affect athletic performance is largely unknown, with prior studies showing mixed results.To evaluate postconcussion National Hockey League player performance using advanced hockey metrics over short- (5 games), medium- (10 games), and long-term (remainder of the season) seasonal performance.Retrospective cohort study.National Hockey League players who sustained a sport-related concussion (SRC; n = 93) and returned during the same season and players (n = 51) who missed time for non–injury-related reasons.Six performance metrics were used: (1) points per 60 minutes, (2) Corsi percentage, (3) personal Fenwick shooting percentage, (4) scoring chances per 60 minutes, (5) penalty difference, and (6) PDO (not an acronym but sometimes referred to as SVSP\% [save percentage shooting percentage]). Performance was compared using 2 (group) × 2 (time) repeated-measures analyses of variance for 3 time windows: (1) ±5 games, (2) ±10 games, and (3) the remainder of the season postconcussion. Alpha values were set at a conservative .01 to account for the lack of independence among dependent variables.No significant interactions were present for any of the 6 dependent variables at any of the 3 time windows. Overall, none of the secondary variables differed.Using advanced, sport-specific metrics, we found that National Hockey League players did not display worse seasonal performance during 3 postinjury time frames after they sustained an SRC. Whereas laboratory studies have identified lingering neurologic deficits after concussion, our results suggest that these deficits, if present, either do not translate to worse athletic performance or were not captured by these 44 metrics. Further, prospective efforts are needed to accurately quantify performance after SRC among professional hockey players.},

	abstract = {Objectives
To provide normative data and establish percentile curves for long-course (50 m pool length) swimming events and to compare progression of race times longitudinally for the various swimming strokes and race distances.
Design
Descriptive approach with longitudinal tracking of performance data.
Methods
A total of 2,884,783 race results were collected from which 169,194 annual best times from early junior to elite age were extracted. To account for drop-outs during adolescence, only swimmers still competing at age of peak performance (21–26 years) were included and analyzed retrospectively. Percentiles were established with z-scores around the median and the Lambda-Mu-Sigma (LMS) method applied to account for potential skewness. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measure and between-subject factor was applied to compare race times across the various events and age groups.
Results
Percentile curves were established based on longitudinal tracking of race times specific to sex, swimming stroke, and race distance. Comparing performance progression, race times of freestyle sprint events showed an early plateau with no further significant improvement (p {\textgreater} 0.05) after late junior age (15–17 years). However, the longer the race distance, the later the race times plateaued (p {\textless} 0.05). Female swimmers generally showed an earlier performance plateau than males. Backstroke and freestyle showed an earlier performance plateau compared to the other swimming strokes (p {\textless} 0.05).
Conclusions
Performance progression varied between sex, swimming strokes, and race distances. Percentile curves based on longitudinal tracking may allow an objective assessment of swimming performance, help discover individual potentials, and facilitate realistic goal setting for talent development.},

We believe strongly in case studies featuring real data and real research questions; thus, most of the data in the textbook arises from collaborative research conducted by the authors and their students, or from student projects.

	abstract = {We develop a Bayesian "sum-of-trees" model where each tree is constrained by a regularization prior to be a weak learner, and fitting and inference are accomplished via an iterative Bayesian backfitting MCMC algorithm that generates samples from a posterior. Effectively, BART is a nonparametric Bayesian regression approach which uses dimensionally adaptive random basis elements. Motivated by ensemble methods in general, and boosting algorithms in particular, BART is defined by a statistical model: a prior and a likelihood. This approach enables full posterior inference including point and interval estimates of the unknown regression function as well as the marginal effects of potential predictors. By keeping track of predictor inclusion frequencies, BART can also be used for model-free variable selection. BART's many features are illustrated with a bake-off against competing methods on 42 different data sets, with a simulation experiment and on a drug discovery classification problem.},

A probit model is a popular specification for a binary response model. As such it treats the same set of problems as does logistic regression using similar techniques. When viewed in the generalized linear model framework, the probit model employs a probit link function. It is most often estimated using the maximum likelihood procedure, such an estimation being called a probit regression.},
