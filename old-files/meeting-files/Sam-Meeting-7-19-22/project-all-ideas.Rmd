### Purpose

During 2020-2021, many hockey leagues (including NHL feeder leagues) had shortened seasons or no season due to the restrictions on play caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Some players experiencing restrictions on play in played in other leagues or tournaments during the 2021-2022 season. Others did not play any league/tournament games during the 2020-2021 season. This poses the question of whether not playing games during the 2020-2021 COVID season negatively impacted player development (or caused players to get worse). To answer this question, we will examine data from the Ontario Hockey League, which did not play any games during the 2020-2021 season. Some players from this league chose to play in other leagues or tournaments while others did not.

### Data

```{r data}
ohl <- read_csv("../sams_ohl_data_request.csv")
ohl_covid <- ohl %>%
  filter(season %in% c("2019-2020","2020-2021", "2021-2022"))
```

### Prep data

```{r}
## Add treatment var:

# Filtering only for players who played more than 10 games (should we combine number of games played across leagues?)
ohl_20_21 <- ohl %>%
  filter(season == "2020-2021", gp > 10)

# Split players up into treatment vs non-treatment
ohl_treatment <- ohl %>%
  filter(season %in% c("2019-2020", "2021-2022"), league == "OHL") %>%
  group_by(player_id, season) %>%
  mutate(ppg = sum(pts)/sum(gp),
         treatment = ifelse(player_id %in% ohl_20_21$player_id, "Played", "Didn't play")
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

plyr_quality <- ohl %>%
  filter(season == "2019-2020", league == "OHL") %>%
  group_by(player_id) %>%
  mutate(plyr_quality = sum(pts)/sum(gp)) %>%
  filter(duplicated(player_id) == FALSE) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(player_id, plyr_quality)

# View(plyr_quality %>%
#   filter(duplicated(plyr_quality$player_id) == TRUE))
# ## need to deal with duplicate players/rows
# View(ohl_filtered %>%
#   filter(duplicated(ohl_filtered$player_id) == TRUE))


# We need to check that each player played in the OHL in 2019-2020 and 2021-2022
ohl_szn <- ohl %>%
  filter(season %in% c("2019-2020", "2021-2022"), league == "OHL") %>%
  group_by(player_id) %>%
  mutate(played_2019 = season == "2019-2020",
         played_2021 = season == "2021-2022",
         played_both_szn = sum(played_2019) & sum(played_2021)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(played_both_szn == TRUE) 

# add treatment variable through join
ohl_trt <- ohl_szn %>%
  left_join(select(ohl_treatment, player_id, season, team_name, treatment), by = c("player_id", "team_name", "season")) %>%
  mutate(ppg = pts/gp) 

# add age variable
ohl_age <- ohl_trt %>%
  group_by(player_id, season) %>%
  mutate(year = strsplit(season, "-")[[1]][2]) %>%
  mutate(age = trunc((dob %--% as.Date(paste0(year, "-05-01"))) / years(1))) %>%
  ungroup() #%>%
  #filter(age %in% 16:22)
    
# add player quality
# ohl_qlty <- ohl_age %>%
#   left_join(plyr_quality, by = "player_id") %>%
#   group_by(player_id, season) %>%
#   mutate(ppg_total = sum(pts)/sum(gp),
#          gp_total = sum(gp),
#          pts_total = sum(pts)) %>%
#   arrange(player_id, season, -plyr_quality) %>%
#   filter(duplicated(player_id) == FALSE) %>%
#   ungroup()#%>%
#   # filter(ppg != 0) %>%
#   # mutate(log_ppg = log(ppg))

ohl_qlty2 <- ohl_age %>%
  left_join(plyr_quality, by = "player_id") %>%
  group_by(player_id, season) %>%
  summarize_at(vars(gp, pts), "sum") %>%
  group_by(player_id) %>% 
  mutate(ppg_total = pts/gp, count_seasons = n()) %>% 
  filter(count_seasons == 2) %>%
  ungroup()

# were they drafted
ohl_filtered <- ohl_qlty %>%
  mutate(drafted = !is.na(draft_year)) %>%
  select(season, player_id, treatment, first_name, last_name, position, plyr_quality, age, gp_total, pts_total, ppg_total, drafted, draft_year, round, overall_pick_num, shoots)

## Trying to combine players who played for two teams into one

# combined <- ohl_filtered %>%
  

ohl_treatment_21_22 <- ohl_filtered %>%
  filter(season == "2021-2022")
```

Wrangling:

Filtering:

- 2019-2020 ("pre-COVID") and 2021-2022 ("post-COVID") seasons

- league == OHL

- Only players who played in the OHL during both pre- and post-COVID seasons

Variables added:

- points per game per season (combined if a player played for multiple teams in a season)

- games played per season (combined if a player played for multiple teams in a season)

- treatment (i.e. whether a player played more than 10 games during the COVID season)

- age (approximately the oldest a player was in a given season)

- player quality approximated by ppg in pre-COVID season

- whether a player was drafted (not totally up to date)

### EDA

```{r}
library(GGally)

ohl_filtered %>%
  select(season, position, age, ppg_total, plyr_quality, gp_total, treatment) %>%
  ggpairs()
```

```{r}
ggplot(ohl_treatment_21_22, aes(x = ppg_total, color = treatment)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Skaters who played during COVID season appear to have\nperformed better post-COVID")
```

But is this difference "real"? Aka did not playing during the COVID season cause players to get worse at hockey or can this difference simply be explained by confounding variables?

#### EDA with confounders: position, age, player quality, treatment, GP, season

check if explanatory variables are correlated with each other and response.

#### **Concerns about GP (and GP vs PPG)**

```{r}
# distribution of games played
ggplot(ohl_filtered, aes(x = gp_total)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Most players played a significant number of games")
```

```{r}
# is gp correlated with ppg?
ggplot(ohl_filtered, aes(x = gp_total, y = ppg_total)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Relationship between PPG and GP", x = "Total GP", y = "Total PPG")#+
  #geom_smooth()

# ggplot(ohl_filtered, aes(x = gp_total, y = log(ppg_total))) +
#   geom_point() +
#   labs(title = "Log relationship between PPG and GP", x = "Total GP", y = "Total PPG")#+
#   #geom_smooth()
```
Takeaways:

- players who have inflated ppgs with low games played don't seem to be a concern

- There could be some kind of relationship here -> PPG seems to increase with GP

#### **Position**

```{r}
# density curve of ppg faceted by position
ggplot(ohl_filtered) +
  geom_density(aes(x = ppg_total, color = position)) +
  labs(title = "PPG generally greater for forwards in 2019-20 and 2021-22 season")
```

Takeaways:

- Definitely something to control for in our model

```{r}
# density curve of ppg faceted by position
ggplot(ohl_filtered) +
  geom_density(aes(x = ppg_total, color = season)) +
  #facet_grid(rows = vars(position)) +
  labs(title = "PPG generally higher in 2021-2022 season",
       x = "PPG")
```

Takeaways: 

- Likely because players get more skilled as they get older, and we are only including players who played both pre- and post-COVID
- Something to control for in our model

```{r}
# maybe due to a difference in amount of data per season?
nrow(filter(ohl_filtered, season == "2019-2020"))
nrow(filter(ohl_filtered, season == "2021-2022"))
```

```{r}
ggplot(ohl_treatment_21_22) +
  geom_density(aes(x = ppg_total, color = treatment)) +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(position)) +
  labs(title = "PPG generally higher for those who played during COVID season\n in 2021-22 season")
```

```{r}
# 
ggplot(ohl_treatment_21_22, aes(x = as.factor(position), y = ppg_total)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .2) +
  stat_summary(geom = "line", fun = mean, group = 1) 
```

Takeaways:

- Greater variance in PPG among forwards

- Higher average PPG among forwards

```{r}
# violates constant variance... much more variance among forwards than Ds
lm_pos <- lm(ppg_total ~ position, data = ohl_filtered)
summary(lm_pos)
plot(lm_pos)
```


#### **Age**

**Does PPG increase as players get older?**

```{r}
ggplot(ohl_filtered, aes(x = ppg_total, y = as.factor(age))) +
  geom_density_ridges() +
  labs(title = "PPG likely increases with age",
       x = "PPG",
       y = "Age")
```


**Does player quality increase as players get older?**

```{r}
# player quality vs age
ggplot(ohl_filtered, aes(x = plyr_quality)) +
  geom_density_ridges(aes(y = as.factor(age))) +
  labs(title = "Player quality likely increases with age",
       x = "Player Quality",
       y = "Age")
```

```{r}
plot(lm(plyr_quality ~ age, data = ohl_filtered))
```


```{r}
mosaicplot(table("Age" = ohl_filtered$age,
                 "Position" = ohl_filtered$position),
           main = "Position independent of age",
           shade = TRUE)
```

**Were older players more likely to play during COVID (since older players are likely higher quality players)?**

```{r}
# age vs treatment
mosaicplot(table("Age" = ohl_filtered$age,
                 "Treatment" = ohl_filtered$treatment),
           main = "Playing during COVID season independent of age",
           shade = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# age vs gp
ggplot(ohl_filtered, aes(x = age, y = gp_total)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5)
ggplot(ohl_filtered, aes(x = gp_total)) +
  geom_density() +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(age))
table(ohl_filtered$age)
ggplot(ohl_filtered, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_bar()
```

### Modeling

```{r, warning = TRUE}
# vanilla MLR
mlr <- lm(ppg_total ~ treatment + season + position + plyr_quality + age, data = ohl_filtered)
mlr_summary <- summary(mlr)
plot(mlr)

# ppg on log scale
log_mlr <- lm(log(ppg_total) ~ treatment + season + position + plyr_quality + age, data = filter(ohl_filtered, ppg_total != 0))
summary(log_mlr)
plot(log_mlr)

mlr_int <- lm(ppg_total ~ treatment*position*season*plyr_quality*age*drafted, data = ohl_filtered)
summary(mlr_int)
plot(mlr_int)
```

```{r}
ohl_mod <- ohl_filtered %>%
  mutate(resids = mlr_summary$resid > .3)
```

```{r}
mosaicplot(table("Position" = ohl_mod$position,
                 "Resids" = ohl_mod$resids),
           main = "",
           shade = TRUE)
mosaicplot(table("Shoots" = ohl_mod$shoots,
                 "Resids" = ohl_mod$resids),
           main = "",
           shade = TRUE)
mosaicplot(table("Drafted" = ohl_mod$drafted,
                 "Resids" = ohl_mod$resids),
           main = "",
           shade = TRUE)
```

#### **Player quality**

**Did player quality influence whether someone played during COVID season?**

```{r}
ggplot(ohl_filtered, aes(x = plyr_quality, color = treatment)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Players who played during COVID season were more likely to be higher quality players")
```

Takeaways:

- We should control for this relationship in our model (interaction term in linear model?)
- Note: there are a lot more players who didn't play than played so this may affect our analysis.

### Questions/Concerns

- PPG is likely not adequately measuring player performance (especially for defensemen)
  - Can we get more stats like ice time, shots blocked, shot on goal, turnovers created, etc?
  - NHL data?
- Multiple regression model accounting for all interactions between explanatory variables does not meet conditions for inference.
- Next steps for building models/maybe starting causal inference?
