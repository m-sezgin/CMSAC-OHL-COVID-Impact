### Alternatives to boxplots

1. Jitter plot / strip plot
```{r, warning = FALSE}
recent %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(season), y = ppg)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.4, aes(color = position),
              position=position_jitter(0.2)) +
  theme_bw()
```

2. Violin
```{r, warning = FALSE}
recent %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ppg, y = factor(season))) +
  geom_violin(fill = "cornflowerblue") +
  theme_bw()
```

3. Beeswarm
```{r, warning = FALSE}
recent %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = ppg)) +
  geom_beeswarm(aes(x = ""), cex = 3, alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_bw() +
  coord_flip()
```

4. Density plot with rugs
```{r, warning = FALSE}
recent %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ppg)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = season), alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_rug(alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_bw() 
```

## Confounding Variables
### Player Quality

### Drafted
#### If drafted or not:
```{r, warning = FALSE}
summary(lm(ppg ~ got_drafted, data = recent2))
recent2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ppg)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = got_drafted), alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "points per game", fill = "drafted") +
  facet_wrap(~season)
recent2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ppg)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = got_drafted), alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "points per game", fill = "drafted") +
  facet_wrap(~season)
```

- Very low R-squared value, significant p-value, but we can't use these statistics because model does not meet conditions for inference.

#### Draft pick number / round: 
```{r}
summary(lm(ppg ~ overall_pick_num, data = drafted))
drafted %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gp, y = overall_pick_num)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(x = "games played", y = "draft pick number") +
  theme_bw()
drafted %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(round), y = gp)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.4, aes(color = position),
              position=position_jitter(0.2)) +
  labs(x = "round", y = "games played") +
  theme_bw()
mosaicplot(table(drafted$round, drafted$season))
```

- Coefficient for 'overall_pick_number' is small, but we can't use these statistics because model does not meet conditions for inference.

- The jitter plot shows that some players drafted in the seventh round played about as many games as those drafted in earlier rounds.


#### Position:
```{r}
drafted %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(position), y = gp)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.4, aes(color = draft_year),
              position=position_jitter(0.2)) +
  labs(x = "position", y = "games played", color = "draft year") +
  theme_bw()
drafted %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(position), y = pts)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.4, aes(color = round),
              position=position_jitter(0.2)) +
  labs(x = "position", y = "points", color = "round") +
  theme_bw()
drafted %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(position), y = ppg)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.4, aes(color = round),
              position=position_jitter(0.2)) +
  labs(x = "position", y = "points per game", color = "round") +
  theme_bw()
```

Defensemen have less points and lower points per game than forwards. Players from different draft rounds are intermixed. 

#### ppg in 2019-2020:
```{r}
# players with stats from both 2019-2020 and 2021-2022
summed_both <- recent %>% 
  filter(season %in% c("2019-2020", "2021-2022"))
summed_both <- summed_both %>% 
  group_by(name, season) %>% 
  summarize_at(vars(gp:pm, ppg), "sum")
summed_both <- summed_both %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  mutate(count_seasons = n()) %>% 
  filter(count_seasons == 2)

# density plot
summed_both %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ppg)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = season), alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_rug(alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_bw()
```

Points per game was slightly higher in the 2019-2020 season. 

### Checking Conditions
#### If drafted or not
```{r}
drafted_lm <- lm(ppg ~ got_drafted, data = recent2)
autoplot(drafted_lm)
```

#### Draft pick number / round: 
```{r}
dpick_lm <- lm(ppg ~ overall_pick_num, data = drafted)
autoplot(dpick_lm)
plot(dpick_lm)
dpick_lm2 <- lm(log(ppg) ~ overall_pick_num, data = (filter(drafted, ppg != 0)))
plot(dpick_lm2)
```


## Questions:

1. How do we tell if someone is a first liner?
1. How do we know if it is a tournament or league (since they are the same variable)?
1. Should we be looking at pts or g?
