## Introduction

Project Motivation: Investigate the impact of pandemic restrictions on hockey player development.

In 2020-2021, many hockey leagues had either a shortened season or no season at all due to COVID-19. When a league, such as the OHL, was shutdown, players had to find different leagues and/or tournaments to participate in. Some players were unable to practice with a team for that season. How did this disruption in training influence a player's development? To answer this question, we will examine data from the 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 seasons for junior leagues.

ohl_treatment_21_22 <- ohl_filtered %>%

## Data:
```{r}
recent %>% 
  dplyr::select(team_name, season, league, gp, g, a, pts, pm) %>%
  head(5) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

### What proportion of players played during COVID season?

```{r}
#played vs didn't play
num_played <- nrow(filter(ohl_filtered, treatment == "Played"))
num_didnt <- nrow(filter(ohl_filtered, treatment == "Didn't play"))
print(paste0("proportion who played is ", round(num_played/nrow(ohl_filtered), 3)))
```

### EDA (Treatment)

```{r}
# drafted vs treatment
mosaicplot(table("Drafted" = ohl_filtered$drafted,
                 "Treatment" = ohl_filtered$treatment),
           main = "Drafted players more likely to have played during COVID",
           shade = FALSE)
```
#### Continuous Age vs PPG

```{r}
#continuous age vs ppg
ggplot(ohl_filtered, aes(x = age_continuous, y = ppg_total)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  labs(title = "No relationship between continuous age and PPG",
       x = "Age (continuous)",
       y = "PPG") +
  theme_bw()
ggplot(ohl_filtered, aes(x = age_continuous, y = ppg_total)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5, size = .4) +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(age)) +
  labs(title = "No observable pattern in continuous age",
       x = "Age (continuous)",
       y = "PPG") +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
# ggplot(ohl_filtered, aes(x = pm_relative, color = treatment)) +
#   geom_density() +
#   labs(title = "Players with better relative PM more likely to have played during COVID?")
# ggplot(ohl_filtered, aes(x = pm_rank, fill = treatment)) +
#   geom_bar() +
#   labs()
```

```{r}
ggplot(filter(ohl_filtered, season == "2019-2020"), aes(x = gp_total, color = treatment)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs("Players who played more games in 2019-2020 more likely to have played during COVID?",
       x = "GP in 2019-2020")
```

### Refit Regression Models

#### MLR with interactions that make sense

```{r code-chunk-label}
mlr_interaction <- lm(ppg_total ~ position*plyr_quality + treatment*drafted + gp_total + plyr_quality*gp_total + plyr_quality*drafted + age_continuous*plyr_quality + season, data = ohl_filtered)
plot(mlr_interaction, which = c(1, 2))
summary(mlr_interaction)
```

#### Transfrom PPG -> log(1 + PPG)

```{r}
mlr_log <- lm(log(1 + ppg_total) ~ position*plyr_quality + treatment*drafted + gp_total + plyr_quality*gp_total + plyr_quality*drafted + age_continuous*plyr_quality + season, data = ohl_filtered)
plot(mlr_log, which = c(1, 2))
summary(mlr_log)
```

Takeaways:

- Does not improve upon previous model modeling PPG, maybe even worse.

#### Transform PPG -> sqrt(1 + PPG)

```{r}
mlr_sqrt <- lm(sqrt(1 + ppg_total) ~ position*plyr_quality + treatment*drafted + gp_total + plyr_quality*gp_total + plyr_quality*drafted + age_continuous*plyr_quality + season, data = ohl_filtered)
plot(mlr_sqrt, which = c(1, 2))
summary(mlr_sqrt)
```

Takeaways:

- Does not improve upon previous model modeling PPG, maybe even worse.

### Non-interaction GLM Gamma inverse link

```{r}
# glm gamma distribution
# set.seed(2004)
ohl_filtered <- ohl_filtered %>%
  mutate(is_train = sample(rep(0:1, length.out = nrow(ohl_filtered))),
         ppg_alt = ppg_total + .001)

ohl_glm <- glm(ppg_alt ~ position + plyr_quality + treatment + drafted + gp_total + age_continuous + season,
                         data = ohl_filtered,
                         family = Gamma)
plot(ohl_glm, which = c(1, 2))
summary(ohl_glm)
```

Takeaways:

- This model does not adequately capture the relationship between our predictors and response.

- **Note**: Tried to fit a GLM with interaction using the default Gamma link function (inverse), but it threw an error and said "no valid set of coefficients has been found: please supply starting values"

```{r}
# ohl_glm_interaction <- glm(ppg_alt ~ position*plyr_quality + treatment*drafted + gp_total + plyr_quality*gp_total + plyr_quality*drafted + age_continuous*plyr_quality + season, 
#                          data = ohl_filtered, 
#                          family = Gamma)
# plot(ohl_glm_interaction, which = c(1, 2))
# summary(ohl_glm_interaction)
```

#### Interaction GLM using Gamma distribution with log link function

```{r} 
ohl_glm_interaction <- glm(ppg_alt ~ position*plyr_quality + treatment*drafted + gp_total + plyr_quality*gp_total + plyr_quality*drafted + age_continuous*plyr_quality + season,
                         data = ohl_filtered,
                         family = Gamma(link = log))
plot(ohl_glm_interaction, which = c(1, 2))
summary(ohl_glm_interaction)
```

Takeaways:

- This model does not adequately capture the relationship between our predictors and response (relationship appears non-linear).

- Predictions are not on the correct scale either.

#### Interaction GLM with gaussian log link function

```{r}
# GLM with gaussian log link
ohl_glm_interaction <- glm(ppg_alt ~ position*plyr_quality + treatment*drafted + gp_total + plyr_quality*gp_total + plyr_quality*drafted + age_continuous*plyr_quality + season, 
                         data = ohl_filtered, 
                         family = gaussian(link = log))
plot(ohl_glm_interaction, which = c(1, 2))
summary(ohl_glm_interaction)
```

Takeaways:

- Non-constant variance, not normally distributed towards lower predicted values.

- Models relationship better than previous models.

- Not predicting PPG on the right scale.
