## Introduction 

Project Motivation: Investigate the impact of pandemic restrictions on hockey player development.

*   In 2020-2021 many junior/NHL-feeder leagues had a shortened season or no season
*   Players had to find new leagues and/or tournament
*   Some players did not play that season

## Data

Our dataset is comprised of players who played in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) during the 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022 seasons. The dataset also includes information regarding other leagues they have played in at during their career. There is information regarding season, team, league, points, games played, position, and drafted status. Each row is a player on a certain team in a specific season.

### Wrangling:

**Filtering (unless otherwise specified):**

- 2019-2020 ("pre-COVID") and 2021-2022 ("post-COVID") seasons

- league == OHL

- Only players who played in the OHL during both pre- and post-COVID seasons

**Variables added:**

- points per game  (PPG) per season (combined if a player played for multiple teams in a season)

- games played (GP) per season (combined if a player played for multiple teams in a season)

- treatment (i.e. whether a player played more than 10 games during the COVID season)

- age (approximately the oldest a player was in a given season)

- player quality approximated by plus-minus (PM) relative to average team PM in pre-COVID season

- whether a player was drafted (not totally up to date)

- all players includes any player with data from the 2019-2020, 2020-2021 and/or 2021-2022 seasons

<span style="color: darkblue;">
People that played less games had a higher points per game than those with greater game counts.
</span>

<center>
<style>
div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
<div class = "blue">
_Draft Status "yes" refers to players drafted **before** the 2020-2021 season._
</div>
</center>

#### Seasons Played by Draft Status

```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
mosaicplot(table(recent$got_drafted, recent$season), shade = TRUE,
           main = element_blank())
```

<span style="color: darkblue;">
During the 2020-2021 season the majority of players had already previously been drafted. The following season was dominated by undrafted players in this dataset.
</span>

## Possible Confounding Variables:

#### Draft Pick Number and Games Played

```{r, fig.align = 'center', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width=5}
# draft pick number on x-axis, gp on y-axis
drafted %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = overall_pick_num, y = gp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(x = "Draft Pick Number", y = "Games Played", caption = "Any player that was drafted, regardless of draft year.") +
  theme_bw()
```

<span style="color: darkblue;">
Players picked later in the draft recorded more games.
</span>

#### Draft Pick Status and Games Played

```{r,fig.align = 'center', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10}
recent %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gp)) +
  geom_density(aes(color = factor(got_drafted)), alpha = 0.3) +
  labs(x = "Games Played", y = "Density", color = "Draft Status",
       caption = "All players.") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("royalblue3", "darkgoldenrod3")) +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~season)
```

<span style="color: darkblue;">
According to this graph, during the 2020-2021 season drafted players only played slightly more games than undrafted players. In the 2021-2022 undrafted players particpated in more games. 
</span>

#### Plus-Minus {.tabset}

In the following graphs, the blue line acts as a reference line at y = 0. The gold line is the team's average plus-minus. 

##### Highest Player

```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
rank2 %>% 
  filter(team_name == "Ottawa 67's") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = player_id, y = pm)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean(pm)), color = "darkgoldenrod3") +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0), color = "royalblue3") +
  labs(title = "Ottawa 67's", subtitle = "Highest Player Plus-Minus", 
       y = "Plus-Minus") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_blank()) +
  facet_grid(~season)
```

<span style="color: darkblue;">
The Ottawa 67's contain the individual with the highest plus-minus in the Ontario Hockey League. Overall the team had much lower numbers in the 2021-2022 season. A singular player was not below the mean. 
</span>

##### Lowest Player

```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
rank2 %>% 
  filter(team_name == "North Bay Battalion") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = player_id, y = pm)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean(pm)), color = "darkgoldenrod3") +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0), color = "royalblue3") +
  labs(title = "North Bay Battalion", subtitle = "Lowest Player Plus-Minus", 
       y = "Plus-Minus") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_blank()) +
  facet_grid(~season)
```

<span style="color: darkblue;">
The North Bay Battalion possess the player with the lowest plus-minus in the Ontario Hockey League. This team greatly improved in the later season. The majority switched to above the mean, opposite of the previous season. 
</span>

##### Median Player

```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
rank2 %>% 
  filter(team_name == "Hamilton Bulldogs") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = player_id, y = pm)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean(pm)), color = "darkgoldenrod3") +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0), color = "royalblue3") +
  labs(title = "Hamilton Bulldogs", subtitle = "Median Player Plus-Minus", 
       y = "Plus-Minus") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_blank()) +
  facet_grid(~season)
```

<span style="color: darkblue;">
The mean plus-minus across the OHL is -1. The Hamilton Bulldogs is one of the teams with the highest number of players with that score. This graph looks highly similar to the North Bay Battalion.
</span>

##### Teams

```{r, message = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
teampm <- recent %>%
  filter(league == "OHL") %>%
  group_by(team_name, season) %>%
  arrange(team_name, season, desc(pm)) %>%
  summarize(team_pm = mean(pm))
teampm %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = team_name, y = team_pm)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean(team_pm)), color = "darkgoldenrod3") +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0), color = "royalblue3") +
  labs(title = "Team Plus-Minus", y = "Plus-Minus") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_blank()) +
  facet_grid(~season)
```

The distributions of team plus-minus scores in the 2019-2020 and 2021-2022 are alike.

## Methods

Before performing causal analysis, we wanted to determine whether playing during the COVID season had a significant effect on PPG when controlling for variables (and interactions between variables) suspected to be associated with the response through EDA. Because PPG is right skewed and bounded between 0 and some positive number, the assumptions of ordinary least squares regression are not met. We performed Gamma regression with the log link function to more accurately model the relationship between our response and explanatory variables.

<center>
<style>
div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
<div class = "blue">

Initial model: ppg_alt ~ position * pm_relative + treatment * drafted + gp_total + pm_relative * gp_total + pm_relative * drafted + age_continuous * pm_relative + season

</div>
</center>

```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
ohl_filtered <- ohl_filtered %>%
  mutate(ppg_alt = ppg_total + .001)
ohl_glm_interaction <- glm(ppg_alt ~ position*pm_relative + treatment*drafted + drafted*season + gp_total + pm_relative*gp_total + pm_relative*drafted + age_continuous*pm_relative + season, 
                          data = ohl_filtered, 
                          family = Gamma(log))
plot(ohl_glm_interaction, which = 1)
#summary(ohl_glm_interaction)
```

## Discussion

### Model Results

\(ln(\widehat{\text{PPG} + .001}) = -5.983 + .602*\text{Forward} + .00412*\text{Relative PM} + .0622*\text{Played during COVID} + .365*\text{Drafted} + .0174* \text{GP} + .204*\text{Age} \\ + .0266*\text{Season} + .000635*\text{Forward}*\text{Relative PM} + .338*\text{Played during COVID} * \text{Drafted} -.0000285*\text{relative PM}*\text{GP}\\ + .00570*\text{relative PM}*\text{Drafted} + .000470*\text{Relative PM}*\text{Age}\)

Variables found to be significant at the \(\alpha = .001\) level in our model:

- Position

- Relative PM

- Drafted status

- Games played

- Age

Variables found to be significant at the \(\alpha = .05\) level in our model:

- Interaction of our treatment variable and drafted status

### Limitations

Model limitations:

- The relationship between games played and PPG was shown to be non-linear in our EDA, but we did not account for a non-linear interaction between these variables

Player Performance:

- Defined as \(PPG = \frac{(points + assists)}{games \hspace{.1 cm} played}\)

- May not adequately capture all aspects of a player's performance

- Though we control for position in our model, PPG will generally be higher for forwards than defensemen

- Defensive performance is not well-approximated by PPG, and this measure would bias offensive defensemen as the best-performing defensemen.

- Good defensive forwards may be undervalued using this metric

- A more nuanced measure that incorporates important defensive statistics like turnovers created, passes completed, shots blocked, etc. may better approximate player performance.

Player quality

- Defined by \( player quality = PM_{relative} = PM_{player} - \mu_{team\hspace{.05cm}PM}\)
 
- Plus minus does not account for all of the statistics that might measure the quality of a player (shots blocked, turnovers created, passes completed, etc)

- Does not consider factors like sheltering
 
Treatment Variable:

- Defined as players who participated in more than 10 games during the COVID season in a single league or tournament. 

- We did not control for quality of league. 

- Though typically only the best players are selected to play in championships/tournaments, many of them were not included as treated in our analysis because of their low game count. 

- Conversely, players who played only a lot of games games in mediocre leagues may have been counted as treated.

- Skaters who played more than 10 games cumulatively across two or more different leagues would also not be considered treated, though they played a significant number of games.

- Future analysis could provide a more distinct view of the treatment variable in which both league quality and number of games played are controlled for.


<span style="color: darkblue;">
**Next steps for future work:**
</span>

*   Redefining/tweaking treatment and response variables
*   Perform causal analysis, with a focus on using BART and propensity scores
